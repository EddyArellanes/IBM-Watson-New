    "context": {
      "facebook": {
        "text": "Hi,\n\nWe have a great giveaway for you, but first weâ€™d like for you to follow us so that you can stay updated on the latest news and trends.\n\nPlease take a moment to follow us and let me know when you've followed us by typing DONE:\n\n",
        "buttons": [
          {
            "url": "https://google.com.mx",
            "type": "web_url",
            "title": "Follow IBM Commerce",
            "messenger_extensions": "true",
            "webview_height_ratio": "full"
          }
        ],
        "template_type": "button"
      }
    }
  },  
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "w600_12@yahoo.com.mx_dev/actions/messenger/ShowCards",
      "type": "cloud_function",
      "parameters": {
        "age": "24",

      },
      "credentials": "$private.api_credentials",
      "result_variable": "$user_info"
    }
  ]
}

The Context Variable $private Looks like:
{"api_credentials":{"user":"02908900-4b41-44cb-83f6-68f9962de8ee","password":"VwYHQGuZJ0a3LrKo4Gh0sbhg4Wkj1ZOf5DIpr6DNfO8Uxut8hIeWgBfEXIjJkN5f"}}
